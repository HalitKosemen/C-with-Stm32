# C-with-Stm32
Communicating image processing code with stm32 card . We are trying to send the center of the object to the stm32 card with the image processing code we wrote in visual studio via uart. Since the image processing code is not GPU supported, there are fps drops and processing overload, but we will try to use CUDA in future tests.
